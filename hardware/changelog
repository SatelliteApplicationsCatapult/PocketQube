Software compatibility with V2.0 rev. A maintained.

Proposed changes:
    PSB:
        Update notation (separate names and silkscreen with extra gerber for manufacture)
        RGB LED (ws2813 et al, or separate driver, LP5521 or LM2755 seem cheap and powerful)
        Piezo sounder addition?
    EPS:
        501K awkward resistor value. Replace with 505, 510, 511K, or network of standard resistors for correct value.
    PSB:
        Clean up stubs
        Zero size ident on TMP102
    RFP:
        stop copper short of board edge
        Resist on dipole mount bottom side?

Implemented changes:
    PSB:
        Removal of serial bridge circuitry
        Connection of hardware serial to camera module over PQ60 bus
        Fix silkscreen errors (G1 -> SDA)
        Updating silkscreen dates, revisions etc.
        Added LED and resistor to GPIO12
        Fixed FX8C drill holes and rerouted accordingly
        Fixed Camera B4B JST connector orientation
        Added cathode markings to silkscreen generation
    EPS:
        Adjust PTH positions to avoid sharp pins puncturing battery (and advise roscan to clip excess)
        Move connectors to accommodate battery dimensions correctly (Battery connector beside header)
        Move jumper further out for accessibility (but not too far we can't fit the panel)
        Pull down resistors on switched outputs
        3.3v system voltage instead of 3.0
        LDO input and output capacitors (RTFDS)
        BQ charge regulater - RTFDS! caps, programming resistors etc.
        Shink tag-connect footprint
        Remove paste layer from tag-connect footprint
        Smaller oscillator
        Remove duplicate SWD connections
        Remove voltage divider BJT switches
        Increase divider precision
        Silkscreen, make jumper location obvious and polarity markings bigger
    OBC:
        Fix IMU address pullups
        Increase IMU supply capacitance
        Correct SD socket footprint
        Add reprogram button
        Move u.fl further from radio module
        Update RFM69 pinout
        Connector locations for ease of access
        Mosfet switching to reset SD card. 
    RFP:
        Change dimensions to suit structure
        Update silkscreen
        Fix groundplane
        Adjust silkscreen for visibility when in structure
        Add orientation markings
